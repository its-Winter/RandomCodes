## Thank you for coming
This repository is for my random scripts (Primarily CMD/Batch scripts) that I create while I'm working on coding in general.
I plan to get a good grip on batch file making and understanding the windows command prompt.
Take a look at some of the codes yourself if you'd like! None are harmful to any part of Windows or any files!
Check [this](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/87954/how-do-i-download-a-particular-file-from-github) out to see the best way to get one of my codes without a hassle.
Easiest way is to open the source code of the script you want and 
paste it into a text file and change the file format from (.txt) to (.bat). Anyway thanks for coming to this page in the 
first place, I appreciate it!
GIVE ME IDEAS FOR SCRIPTS PLEASE contact me at its.Winter#6512 on discord!! :))
