# Thank you for coming
This repository is for my random codes (Primarily CMD/Batch files) that I create while I'm working on coding in general.
I plan to get a good grip on batch file making and understanding the windows command prompt.
Take a look at some of the codes yourself if you'd like, be warned some of them arefor fun and can potentially cause pc slow down and/or crash. Take care with these codes and read about which one does.
