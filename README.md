# Thank you for coming
This repository is for my random scripts (Primarily CMD/Batch scripts) that I create while I'm working on coding in general.
I plan to get a good grip on batch file making and understanding the windows command prompt.
Take a look at some of the codes yourself if you'd like! None are harmful to any part of Windows or any files!
It will 100% probably say that "This file may be harmful" on download and if you keep it then windows will always say that it 
protected your PC. It says this because your downloading a batch file from the internet and it could be anything but 
windows doesnt know what the code does until you run it. Easiest way is to open the source code of the script you want and 
paste it into a text file and change the file format from (.txt) to (.bat). Anyway thanks for coming to this page in the 
first place, I appreciate it!
GIVE ME IDEAS FOR SCRIPTS PLEASE contact me at its.Winter#6512 on discord!! :))
