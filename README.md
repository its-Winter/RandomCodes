      Thank You for coming!

This repository is for my random scripts and projects that I create while I'm working on coding in general.
I plan to get a good grip on script making and understanding the fundementals of programming.
Take a look at some of the codes yourself if you'd like! **None are harmful to any part of your computer!**
You can download the scripts from the repository here on Gitlab/Github! (All browsers will say the batch scripts are harmful but I promise they're not. If there's proof of otherwise then please contact me!)
Anyway thanks for coming to this page in the 
first place, I appreciate it!
